Puppet::Type.type(:service).provide :puppetizer, :parent => :runit do
  desc <<-'EOT'
    Runit service management contained in puppetizer env.

    This provider manages daemons running supervised by Runit.
    When detecting the service directory it will check, in order of preference:

    * `/opt/puppetizer/service`

    The daemon directory should be in one of the following locations:

    * `/opt/puppetizer/etc/service`

    This provider supports out of the box:

    * start/stop
    * enable/disable
    * restart
    * status
